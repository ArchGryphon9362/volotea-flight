# Volotea Flight

I've noticed Volotea logging some fun stuff on their free WiFi, so I decided to make a logger for it :)

The only piece of information that this is lacking compared to their website is flight progress, but I think they use http://cesiumjs.org/ to derive it, so this is fun.

If you ever try to run this script for yourself be sure to let me know how it goes on the issues page.

To run, simply run

```bash
python3 main.py
```
